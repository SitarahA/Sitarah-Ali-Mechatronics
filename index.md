# Welcome​

Creating things is my passion. For most of my life, that meant art. I’d pour hours and hours into improving my drawings and characters. However, after taking an Electronics Class in high school, I found a new path for my desire to create. Now, I’m a full time Mechatronics Engineering student at NIU expected to graduate in Spring 2027, a member of my university’s Robotics Club, and looking to build a career where I can fully use my love of creation and innovation. Whenever I’m free, you’ll either find me drawing, or trying to learn something new.

I’m currently looking into learning or teaching myself more career relevant skills, such as:
- SolidWorks
- MatLab
- Arduino
- Microsoft Access

Art is still prevalent in my life. As a hobby I’m used to, it's one of the easiest ways for me to create. However, I’ve become interested in learning other creative avenues, including:
- Game development (specifically, Godot)
- Comic Writing
- 2D & 3D Animation
- Music Composition

I’m currently seeking a summer internship in mechatronics engineering where I can use my creativity, and learn something new. Know any opportunities or want to reach out? Feel free to connect! Let’s create something amazing.

  <summary>BP01 - Discovering Open Source</summary>
  ## What is Open Source?
  
**_Open Source_** is a term used to describe software that has had its code made publically available and accessible. This allows for:
- Users of the software get *transparency* and know exactly whats going on behind the scenes of the programs they're using
- Developers from outside the original team have the opportunity to *contribute* and continue/enhance development
- Aspiring developers can use this publicly viewable source code for *reference* in their own projects to see how someone else accomplished a certain task
- The creation of *deviations* of a project with certain modifications that may not be wanted in the original, but others find use in
- Projects being further *maintained* after the original devleopers abandon a project via third party developers.

## What Surprised Me?

I learned some software I use is open source that I wasn't expecting to be! For example - The Android operating system is open source, as well as the Windows Terminal and Calculator. I was also surprised to find that many larger corporations have numerous open source projects. Typically, I expect larger companies to be more protective of their work. Which leads into the next part of the prompt...

## Which Well-Known Companies and Projects Use Open Source?

### [Google](https://opensource.google/projects/)

  - Android
  - Chromium (for browsers)
    - Some other browsers that use this (besides Chrome) include Brave, Arc, and OperaGX
  - ChromiumOS (for Chromebooks)
  - 
### [Microsoft](opensource.microsoft.com/projects/)

- Visual Studio Code
- Power Toys
- Windows Terminal
- Windows Calculator
- 
### [Apple](https://opensource.apple.com/projects/)

- Swift (programming language for software development)
- Password Management Resources

And more!

## Why does it Matter?

Larger companies making their software open source allows for developers outside the original team to make contributions and modifications. It also allows for developers to build upon the software in their own ways for their own projects, so they can make something without building something potentially daunting from scratch

### Here's some cool projects that are open source:

- [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) - a game engine for 2D or 3D games. Some people also use it to make more general purpose software
- [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) - Powerful 3D modeling/animating software, as well as a video editor
- [Blockbench](https://www.blockbench.net/) - a lighter lowpoly 3D modeling software, more commonly used in the minecraft modding niche ([though some artists can make some really cool stuff with it outside of minecraft](https://twitter.com/violxiv/status/1942344562380292176))
- [Krita](https://krita.org/) - a digital illustration software with some animation functionality. Basically free photoshop for digital artists. I used to use this, its pretty good!
- [OpenToonz](https://opentoonz.github.io) - A 2D animation software. Studio Ghibli uses a customized version of this in their workflow
- [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/) - an image manipulator
- [BeepBox](https://www.beepbox.co) - Music making software that operates in your browser. The song is saved in the url.
  - Has lots of forks, such as [JummBox](https://jummb.us), [PaandorasBox](https://nintarigenesis.bitbucket.io/), and [UltraBox](https://ultraabox.github.io/)
