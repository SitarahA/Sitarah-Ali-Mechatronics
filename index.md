# Welcome​

Creating things is my passion. For most of my life, that meant art. I’d pour hours and hours into improving my drawings and characters. However, after taking an Electronics Class in high school, I found a new path for my desire to create. Now, I’m a full time Mechatronics Engineering student at NIU expected to graduate in Spring 2027, a member of my university’s Robotics Club, and looking to build a career where I can fully use my love of creation and innovation. Whenever I’m free, you’ll either find me drawing, or trying to learn something new.

I’m currently looking into learning or teaching myself more career relevant skills, such as:
- SolidWorks
- MatLab
- Arduino
- Microsoft Access

Art is still prevalent in my life. As a hobby I’m used to, it's one of the easiest ways for me to create. However, I’ve become interested in learning other creative avenues, including:
- Game development (specifically, Godot)
- Comic Writing
- 2D & 3D Animation
- Music Composition

I’m currently seeking a summer internship in mechatronics engineering where I can use my creativity, and learn something new. Know any opportunities or want to reach out? Feel free to connect! Let’s create something amazing.

  <summary>BP01 - Discovering Open Source</summary>
### **What is Open Source?**
**_Open Source_** is a term used to describe software that has had its code made publically available and accessible. This allows for:
- Users of the software get *transparency* and know exactly whats going on behind the scenes of the programs they're using
- Developers from outside the original team have the opportunity to *contribute* and continue/enhance development
- Aspiring developers can use this publicly viewable source code for *reference* in their own projects to see how someone else accomplished a certain task
- The creation of *deviations* of a project with certain modifications that may not be wanted in the original, but others find use in
- Projects being further *maintained* after the original devleopers abandon a project via third party developers.
### **What Surprised Me?**
I learned some software I use is open source that I wasn't expecting to be! For example - The Android operating system is open source, as well as the Windows Terminal and Calculator. I was also surprised to find that many larger corporations have numerous open source projects. Typically, I expect larger companies to be more protective of their work. Which leads into the next part of the prompt...
### **Which Well-Known Companies and Projects Use Open Source?**
### [Google](https://opensource.google/projects/)
  - Android
  - Chromium (for browsers)
    - Some other browsers that use this (besides Chrome) include Brave, Arc, and OperaGX
  - ChromiumOS (for Chromebooks)
### [Microsoft](opensource.microsoft.com/projects/)
- Visual Studio Code
- Power Toys
- Windows Terminal
- Windows Calculator
### [Apple](https://opensource.apple.com/projects/)
- Swift (programming language for software development)
- Password Management Resources

And more!
### **Why does it Matter?**
Larger companies making their software open source allows for developers outside the original team to make contributions and modifications. It also allows for developers to build upon the software in their own ways for their own projects, so they can make something without building something potentially daunting from scratch

### Here's some cool projects that are open source:
- [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) - a game engine for 2D or 3D games. Some people also use it to make more general purpose software
- [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) - Powerful 3D modeling/animating software, as well as a video editor
- [Blockbench](https://www.blockbench.net/) - a lighter lowpoly 3D modeling software, more commonly used in the minecraft modding niche ([though some artists can make some really cool stuff with it outside of minecraft](https://twitter.com/violxiv/status/1942344562380292176))
- [Krita](https://krita.org/) - a digital illustration software with some animation functionality. Basically free photoshop for digital artists. I used to use this, its pretty good!
- [OpenToonz](https://opentoonz.github.io) - A 2D animation software. Studio Ghibli uses a customized version of this in their workflow
- [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/) - an image manipulator
- [BeepBox](https://www.beepbox.co) - Music making software that operates in your browser. The song is saved in the url.
  - Has lots of forks, such as [JummBox](https://jummb.us), [PaandorasBox](https://nintarigenesis.bitbucket.io/), and [UltraBox](https://ultraabox.github.io/)

  <summary>BP02 - GitHub and Markdown</summary>
  Prompt:
> “What I learned about Markdown and Git, and how they help me contribute to open source and improve professionally. Have you use them before? What surprised you about Markdown or Git?”

### **What have I learned about Markdown and Git?**
Markdown is super simple. Its used in a lot of places I didn't originally realize, such as Discord, and Microsoft Teams. Its very helpful for versatile formatting that simply raw text cannot accomplish.
Git is a software for managing the development of programs. GitHub is built on Git, and runs in the cloud. Git is also made by the same person who made Linux, [Linus Torvalds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds).

### **How do they help me contribute to open source?**
Markdown helps clearly communicate ideas. This can be in the form of documentation for how to use a software, or in discussions when evaluating new potential features and progress for a project. Git is important to understand the background of what an open source project is doing. It is also important to understand what the standard procedure is for contributing to collaborative developments that use Git, so as to not interrupt the work from other devs. 

### **How do they help me improve professionally?**
Many projects I have been involved in used GitHub in some way, which is built on Git. Understanding Git allows me to better and more efficiently contribute to these projects. Markdown allows for professional, versitile, and effective formatting of ideas I want to communicate. This can be used to ensure important details are emphasized and making a given post appear more polished.

### **Have I used them before?**
I've used Markdown in Discord and Microsoft Teams. Discord has its own modified version of Markdown. While many bits of Markdown are missing in Discord's version of it, it does add some of its own features. For example, you can <ins>underline</ins> something by using underscores instead of HTML tags! The extent that I've used Git is only what we've done in class, and any time I've used it by messing with GitHub. This includes referencing a friend's code for a minecraft mod, accessing downloads for open source projects, and messing with the GitHub Pages (for a since discarded repo).

### **What surprised me about Markdown or Git?**
Git looks intimidating with the terminal, but really its still the same features. Instead of a visual GUI like with GitHub, information and tasks are accessed with their respective commands.

Markdown in Github is very, _very_ versatile. I learned about new features like footnotes and alerts. Anything Markdown doesn't directly cover can be supplemented with HTML!

  <summary>BP03 - Repo Exploration</summary>
  Prompt:
> How I chose a repository to explore and what I found interesting about its structure, community, and contribution process

During today's class, I chose to evaluate the repository for [Aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org/), a popular pixel art and animation editor that I have just a little bit of experience with.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/92ff362b-06fa-4e45-98f6-31b6c9b6d0b0" />
</p>

I decided to evaluate this repository since I was curious about how a project I use so often was maintained.

Some things I found interesting about the structure of Aseprite's Repository:

- The **Contribution** and **Code of Conduct** sections were beside the README
- The 3 liscense distributions were listed in the README
- Its communities are linked to with Discord and their own site
- For contributing and engagine with the community, they have a Code of Conduct

While the issues and pull requests are actively closed, the developers don't seem to be that responsive to issues in the comments.

With the table from this class's activity, here's how I would rate it:

| Criteria | ✅ Yes | ⚠️ Partially | ❌ No
|---------|--------|--------------|-------
| **1. Clear README** – Includes project purpose, setup instructions, usage, and examples.|✅ | | |
| **2. CONTRIBUTING Guide Available** – Explains how to contribute, coding standards, or where to start. |    ✅    |              |       |
| **3. License is Included** – Specifies how the code can be used, modified, and shared. |    ✅    |              |       |
| **4. Beginner-Friendly Labels Exist** – e.g., `good first issue`, `help wanted`, etc. |   ✅     |              |       |
| **5. Recent Activity** – Commits, issues, or PRs active in the last 1–2 months. |    ✅    |              |       |
| **6. Maintainers Respond** – Signs of regular interaction with contributors. |        |              |   ❌    |
| **7. Welcoming Community Tone** – Issue threads and PRs show respectful, helpful communication. |        |       ⚠️       |       |
| **8. Match to Your Interests / Skills** – Aligns with your learning goals or academic interests. |        |       ⚠️       |       |
