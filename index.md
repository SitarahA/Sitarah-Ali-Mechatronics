Creating things is my passion. For most of my life, that meant art. I’d pour hours and hours into improving my drawings and characters. However, after taking an Electronics Class in high school, I found a new path for my desire to create. Now, I’m a full time Mechatronics Engineering student at NIU expected to graduate in Spring 2027, a member of my university’s Robotics Club, and looking to build a career where I can fully use my love of creation and innovation. Whenever I’m free, you’ll either find me drawing, or trying to learn something new.

I’m currently looking into learning or teaching myself more career relevant skills, such as:
- SolidWorks
- MatLab
- Arduino
- Microsoft Access

Art is still prevalent in my life. As a hobby I’m used to, it's one of the easiest ways for me to create. However, I’ve become interested in learning other creative avenues, including:
- Game development (specifically, Godot)
- Comic Writing
- 2D & 3D Animation
- Music Composition

I’m currently seeking a summer internship in mechatronics engineering where I can use my creativity, and learn something new. Know any opportunities or want to reach out? Feel free to connect! Let’s create something amazing.
